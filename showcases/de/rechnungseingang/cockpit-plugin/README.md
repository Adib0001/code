Sample Reporting plugin for camunda Cockpit
=================================

This is a sample plugin for the "rechnungseingang" demo application.


Highcharts is not free or open source!
----------------------

Please note that I used [Highcharts](http://www.highcharts.com/) for that example which is NOT free.
You have to buy a license in order to use the plugin shown here, see [Highcharts FAQ](http://shop.highsoft.com/faq). 
Or you have to replace it with some other JavaScript libraries drawing charts.


How to use
----------------------

1. Build the plugin using maven with mvn clean install

2. Integrate the JAR in your camunda-*.war file and there under WEB-INF/lib

Now it will be shown on the start screen.
