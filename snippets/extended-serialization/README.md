extended-serialization
=========================

If you use libraries like Joda Money in your project you need some special setup to deserialize your Money-objects from JSON.

This setup may help you to overcome the exceptions like

    org.camunda.bpm.engine.ProcessEngineException: Cannot deserialize object in variable 'product': SPIN/JACKSON-JSON-01006 Cannot deserialize ...
 
and 

    Caused by: spinjar.com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.JsonMappingException: No suitable constructor found for type [simple type, class org.joda.money.Money]: can not instantiate from JSON object (need to add/enable type information?)
    
This project has been generated by the Maven archetype
[camunda-archetype-servlet-war-7.2.1](http://docs.camunda.org/latest/guides/user-guide/#process-applications-maven-project-templates-archetypes).

Built and tested against Camunda BPM version 7.2.0.

How does it work?
-----------------

To test the dataFormatConfigurator, it uses this process:

![BPMN Process](src/test/resources/process.png)

How to use it?
--------------

There is no web interface to access the application.
To get started refer to the `InMemoryH2Test`.

You can also use `ant` to build and deploy the example to an application server.
For that to work you need to copy the file `build.properties.example` to `build.properties`
and configure the path to your application server inside it.
Alternatively, you can also copy it to `${user.home}/.camunda/build.properties`
to have a central configuration that works with all projects generated by the
[Camunda BPM Maven Archetypes](http://docs.camunda.org/latest/guides/user-guide/#process-applications-maven-project-templates-archetypes).

Once you deployed the application you can run it using
[Camunda Tasklist](http://docs.camunda.org/latest/guides/user-guide/#tasklist)
and inspect it using
[Camunda Cockpit](http://docs.camunda.org/latest/guides/user-guide/#cockpit).
