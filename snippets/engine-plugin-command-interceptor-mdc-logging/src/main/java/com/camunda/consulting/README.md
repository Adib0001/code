## Adding context information to the log output

This engine plugin shows how to add the engine name to the log statements using MDC. An example usecase could be running multiple process engines inside the same application server with the requirement to separate log files for each engine.

Similar functionality but different context information can be found in the [process data context logging feature](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.12/user-guide/logging/#process-data-context).
