jsf-simple-tasklist
=========================

This is an example for a simple task list build with JSF and CDI. 
You can start new process instances and work on JSF task forms and complete them.

If the process definition has an external form on the start event, it will be used. 
Otherwise the process instance will be started.

How to use it?
--------------

Deploy this project to your running Camunda JBoss or Wildfly distribution with either `mvn clean jboss-as:deploy` or 
use `ant` to build and deploy the example to an application server.
For that to work you need to copy the file `build.properties.example` to `build.properties`
and configure the path to your application server inside it.
Alternatively, you can also copy it to `${user.home}/.camunda/build.properties`
to have a central configuration that works with all projects generated by the
[Camunda BPM Maven Archetypes](http://docs.camunda.org/latest/guides/user-guide/#process-applications-maven-project-templates-archetypes).
