## Integrating Keycloak with Camunda using the Keycloak Spring Boot adapter

This is another example of how to achieve SSO with Camunda. This one uses the [plain Spring Boot adapter for Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/securing_apps/index.html#_spring_boot_adapter), not the one that integrates with Spring Security.

The example also uses the [camunda-identity-keycloak plugin](https://github.com/VonDerBeck/camunda-identity-keycloak) from the community.

Another example of how to use external authentication can be found in the [Camunda SSO JBoss Project](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-sso-jboss) or the [Camunda Spring Security Example](https://github.com/camunda-consulting/code/tree/master/snippets/springboot-security-sso).
